This is a dropper for Windows.

## How to use
* Clone the repo to the directory you would like to drop into.
* Run the .exe along with the IP address of the server and the port it is listening on

### Please note
* You may use your own c2, netcat or metasploit. Alternatively, you may grab a copy of the server found in my firewall-evasion repo.
